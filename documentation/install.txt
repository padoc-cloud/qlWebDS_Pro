If you follow the instructions precisely, your installation or upgrade will be a smooth one.

Requirements: Linux Apache Server (preferred) with Mod Rewrite (preferred) or any other Server, PHP 4.0 or higher and MySQL 4.1 or higher

We recommend backing up your Website before installing any script
Create a new MySQL Database
In the db_params.php file enter your information from your MySQL database:
dbHost (localhost, database URL/connection string, "mysql" or IP Address) in most cases it will be: localhost
dbName (database name)
dbUser (database username)
dbPass (database password)
Open an FTP connection to your server
To set up your site as a Directory only, upload all files to your server's public_html, docs or htdocs directory.
or to the directory of your additional site(s) where you plan to install the script
If you are installing the script in a Subfolder (www.YourSite.com/Subfolder/), assign 755 permissions to the Subfolder now (chmod 755 YourSubfolderName/) and upload all files to it
On your Serve assign permissions to the following files and directories:
Assign 777 permissions to backup directory (chmod 777 backup/)
Assign 777 permissions to cache directory (chmod 777 cache/)
Assign 777 permissions to coupons directory (chmod 777 coupons/)
Assign 777 permissions to logos directory (chmod 777 logos/)
Assign 777 permissions to logs directory (chmod 777 logs/)
Assign 666 permissions to asf.txt (chmod 666 asf.txt)
Assign 666 permissions to registration_.html (chmod 666 registration_.html)
Assign 666 permissions to sitemap.xml.gz (chmod 666 sitemap.xml.gz)
Assign 666 permissions to users_online.txt (chmod 666 users_online.txt)

DO NOT remove registration_.html or any other files from your server as this would make the script inoperative!
The .htaccess file (htaccess.txt) makes the Main Menu Items - Search Engine Friendly - even if your Mod Rewrite is off
Customize the htaccess.txt file (instructions are inside the file) and upload it to your server.
Then, on your Server: rename htaccess.txt to .htaccess (allows Search Engine friendly URLs for your Categories, Links and the Main Menu Links)
REMEMBER: On some hosting accounts it'll take up to 1 hour for your Mod Rewrite to start working once you activate your .htaccess file, so be patient!

If .htaccess file was installed, turn Mod Rewrite on in Admin - Config/Site Settings
In your browser type in http://www.YourDomain.com/install.php  OR  http://www.YourDomain.com/SubFolder/install.php
Follow the instructions on the screen.
For Deluxe, Premium, Pro and Supreme versions, you will need your Installation Registration Number that was displayed on the screen above your download link and also e-mailed to you
Create and memorize your Admin Username, Password and your E-mail
Next, click on Admin Area link and log in to Admin using the username and password you just assigned to your directory
Your directory WILL NOT work unless you enter your site's URL in Admin: Config/Site Settings
Immediately, delete install.php from from your server
In order for your Directory to function, you must fill out all necessary fields in Config/Site Settings
Go to Admin/Templates Menu, choose your Template and Activate it
Set up your Admin functions: Description, Categories, Sub-categories, Payments, Ads, Banner Rotator, Link Types, etc.

To finish your installation do the following:
In Admin/Templates - Choose your Template and Activate it
Go through all Menu Choices in Admin (Top Menu Items and Left Menu corresponding Choices) and customize your Directory.
In Site/Sitemap - Generate Sitemap
In Admin/Main - Empty Cache
In Admin/Main - Backup Database
In Admin/Main - Clear PageRank (Premium, Pro and Supreme versions only)
In Admin/Main - Backup Logos  (Pro and Supreme versions only)

It is a good idea to back up your entire Directory Website via an FTP connection now.

Follow the instructions on the screen

Customize the htaccess.txt file (instructions are inside the file) and upload it to your server
The .htaccess file (htaccess.txt) will make the Main Menu Items - Search Engine Friendly - even if your Mod Rewrite is off
On your Server: rename htaccess.txt to .htaccess (allows Search Engine friendly URLs for your Categories, Links and the Main Menu Links)
You may close your FTP connection now
Log in to Admin: http://www.YourDirectory.com/admin/  OR  http://www.YourSite.com/YourDirectory/admin/ OR http://YourDirectory.YourSite.com/admin/
If .htaccess file was needed (for your Categories' Search Engine friendly URLs) and installed, turn Mod Rewrite on in Admin: Config/Site Settings
In Admin: Config/Site Settings enter your Site Name (if upgrading from an old version which did not have this feature)
In Admin: Config/Site Settings enter the number of Subcategories to display (if upgrading from an older version which did not have this feature)
Review and adjust the remaining settings under Config/Site Settings
In Admin: Config/User Settings, review and adjust all settings (if upgrading from an older version which did not have this feature)
